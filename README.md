# Reported

## Developers Experience 
- James is a 3rd year software engineering student. He's had one coop thus far. 
- Dana has graduated in November 2014 from University of Calgary (no coops), and has worked as a software developer in Victoria in downtown for the past year. 
- We've both had some self-taught experience with web applications:
  - Dana learned some AngularJS in February (free online course), has worked with Xamarin at her job in Victoria, played with Ruby on Rails in Summer 2014 and took a web development course at University of Calgary in Winter 2014. 
  - James learned the MEAN stack as part of and outside school. 

Reported is a community driven break-in and theft tracker in your area. Add reports to this map to inform others on recent events.

## Usage
When you first load the website, it will ask you for your location. If you click "Allow", the map will pan to your area. 

To use this application, click a point on the map where you would like to create a report. Add your name, email, and a short description of the incident. If you'd like, you can add an url to a photo for a better description.

Your data point will be displayed on the map for all others to see. Once the page reloads, your new data point will be displayed and the map will pan to it. If you'd like, you can take this moment to delete it.

Zoom in to view datapoints if they are shown in a cluster. Click on a datapoint to see information about it. 

## Future implementations 
 - User accounts. Users would be able to view all their own points, delete and edit them. 
 - Alerts. Users could sign up for alerts for activities in their area
 - Contact form. If anyone has information related to a reported point, they could send the original poster a message. 
 - Image upload. Users should be able to upload one (or more) photos to our server instead of having to use some other image hosting service. 
 - Improved Security. For example, nothing is stopping someone from adding a ton of fake datapoints with a denial of service attack. Additionally, forms are not currently checked for data integrity (e.g. adding a url to a non-existing photo)

## About us 
We're James and Dana, two young developers learning the ropes of programming. We're always looking for ways to improve our coding practices and experience. We enjoy programming competitions together and working on small personal projects together.
