# Reported

Reported is a community driven break-in and theft tracker in your area. Add reports to this map to inform others on recent events.

## Usage
To use this application, click a point on the map where you would like to create a report. Add your name, email, and a short description of the incident. If you'd like, you can add an url to a photo for a better description.

Your data point will be displayed on the map for all others to see. Once the page reloads, your new data point will be displayed. If you'd like, you can take this moment to delete it.

## Future implementations 
 - User accounts. Users would be able to view all their own points, delete and edit them. 
 - Alerts. Users could sign up for alerts for activities in their area
 - Contact form. If anyone has information related to a reported point, they could send the original poster a message. 
 - Image upload. Users should be able to upload one (or more) photos to our server instead of having to use some other image hosting service. 
 - Improved Security. For example, nothing is stopping someone from adding a ton of fake datapoints with a denial of service attack. Additionally, forms are not currently checked for data integrity (e.g. adding a url to a non-existing photo)
